# Target-Heart-Rate Calculator App
While exercising, you can use a heart-rate monitor to see that your heart rate stays within a safe range suggested by your trainers and doctors. According to the American Heart Association (AHA), the formula for calculating your maximum heart rate in beats per minute is 220 minus your age in years (http://bit.ly/AHATargetHeartRates). Your target heart rate is a range that is 50–85% of your maximum heart rate. [Note: These formulas are estimates provided by the AHA. Maximum and target heart rates may vary based on the health, fitness and gender of the individual. Always consult a physician or qualified health care professional before be- ginning or modifying an exercise program.] Write an app that inputs the person’s age, then calcu- lates and displays the person’s maximum heart rate and target-heart-rate range.
