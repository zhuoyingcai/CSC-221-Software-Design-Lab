# Interactive Drawing Application
Create a drawing application that allows user to draw in shapes such as a line, oval and rectangle. Users are able to color
the shape with selected color, undo and clear the whole drawing as they wish. </br>
After finishing the drawing, users can save the drawing locally (with extension .ser) and read the drawing by loading the file to the Interactive Drawing Application.
